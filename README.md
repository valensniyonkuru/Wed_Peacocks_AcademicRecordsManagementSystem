## Project Overview
The Academic Records Management System (ARMS) is designed to streamline and centralize academic data management within educational institutions, providing reliable and secure data handling. The primary goal of ARMS is to improve efficiency, accessibility, and accuracy of academic records for students, instructors, and administrators.

## Project Phases Summary

### Phase 2: Business Process Modeling
In this phase, the team focused on creating business process models related to the management of academic records within the system. This involved:
- **Process Mapping:** Identifying key processes for managing academic data such as student enrollment, grading, and instructor assignments.
- **Modeling Techniques Used:** Swimlanes diagrams and Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) were used to clearly outline workflows and the roles of various stakeholders.

**Deliverables Added to Repository:**
- `PHASE 2.docx`: This document contains the detailed business process modeling of the system, highlighting workflows, tasks, and user interactions.
- `swimlanes.png`: An image showing the swimlanes diagram for the ARMS, illustrating different tasks per role.
- `bpmn.png`: An image showing the BPMN diagram used for understanding and visualizing the academic records processes in ARMS.

### Phase 3: Logical Model Design
In Phase 3, the focus was on designing a detailed logical model for the database. This model includes all required entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints to support the ARMS functionality. The logical model design ensures data integrity and supports complex queries to retrieve and analyze academic data.

**Deliverables Added to Repository:**
- `PHASE 3.docx`: This document outlines the logical data model, describing each entity, key attributes, and relationships among them.
- `FLOW DIAGRAM.PNG`: A flow diagram showing the logical data structure and data flow within ARMS, highlighting relationships like many-to-many between students and courses through enrollment, as well as connections with grades and instructors.
